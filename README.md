# Dinosaurs README

## Dinosaur Infographic - Udacity Intermediate Javascript
This small app receives data from the user and produces an infographic in the form of a 9tile grid.  The user displayed in the middle, 7 dinosaur tiles and one pigeon surround. 
The dinosaurs will dynamically display a random fact about its species or about the comparison made from species data and user input data. 

## Installation
As this project uses the fetch api you will need to run a live-server for the application to run properly.

## Usage
Load your live-server, enter your information into the form and click ‘Compare Me!’.

## Known bugs:
Despite multiple code reviews the ‘get height’ function, that compares user height data with that of the dinosaurs returns undefined.
